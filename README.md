### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Software Engineering student at 42Wolfsburg and I have developed a strong proficiency in C and C++ through hands-on projects that include:

| Project  | Language | Description |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------------|
| [libft](https://github.com/mottjes/libft) | C | The purpose of this project was to create a own libary with some re-coded libc functions, as well as some other common utility functions. |
| [get_next_line](https://github.com/mottjes/get_next_line) | C | This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. It allows you to read content from a file line by line. |
| [ft_printf](https://github.com/mottjes/ft_printf) | C | The project is a partial reimplementation of the printf function. It is mainly to learn about using a variable number of arguments. |
| [push_swap](https://github.com/mottjes/push_swap) | C | This program sorts data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. For this you have 2 stacks named a and b. |
| [so_long](https://github.com/mottjes/so_long) | C | This project is a very small 2D game. |
| [minitalk](https://github.com/mottjes/minitalk) | C | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. |
| [philosophers](https://github.com/mottjes/philosophers) | C | This project is about the Dining Philosophers Problem. The main goal of this project is to learn about the basics of threads and mutexes and to learn to avoid deadlocks and race conditions when creating multithreaded applications. |
| [minishell](https://github.com/mottjes/minishell) | C | This project is about creating a fully functional shell from scratch, which should behave like bash, just with less features |
| [cub3d](https://github.com/mottjes/cub3d) | C | This project is a simple raycaster to simulate 3d rooms, like in the old Wolfenstein 3D game. |
| [cpp_modules](https://github.com/mottjes/cpp_modules) | C++ | This are 10 C++ modules with a series of exercises which are designed to learn and understand the specificities of the language and Object-Oriented Programming. |
| [webserv](https://github.com/mottjes/webserv) | C++ | This project is about writing our own HTTP server from scratch in C++98 |
| [inception](https://github.com/mottjes/inception) | Docker | This project is about setting up a small infrastructure composed of different services using Docker containers. |
